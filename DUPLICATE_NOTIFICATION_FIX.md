# Fix for Duplicate Notification Issue

## Problem Identified
You were getting **two notifications** for each plant scan:
1. ✅ **Correct notification** from `plant.main.ts` with proper analysis details
2. ❌ **Duplicate notification** from `plantscan.service.ts` with wrong type `SOIL_ANALYSIS_SAVED`

## Root Cause
The notification logic was implemented in **two places**:
- **Business Logic Layer** (`plant.main.ts`) - ✅ Correct place with analysis results
- **Data Access Layer** (`plantscan.service.ts`) - ❌ Wrong place with generic info

## Changes Made

### 1. **Removed Duplicate Notification** (`plantscan.service.ts`)
- ❌ Removed the duplicate notification creation in `savePlantScan` method
- ❌ Removed unused notification imports
- ✅ Kept only the core database save functionality

### 2. **Added Proper Notification Type** (`notification.interface.ts`)
- ✅ Added `PLANT_SCAN_COMPLETED` notification type
- ✅ This is more specific than the generic `RECOMMENDATION` type

### 3. **Updated Plant Analysis Notification** (`plant.main.ts`)
- ✅ Changed notification type from `RECOMMENDATION` to `PLANT_SCAN_COMPLETED`
- ✅ Kept the detailed analysis information (diagnosis, recommendations)

## Result
Now you'll get **only ONE notification** per plant scan with:
- ✅ Correct type: `PLANT_SCAN_COMPLETED`
- ✅ Detailed analysis results in the message
- ✅ Proper metadata with farm name, crop type, and diagnosis
- ✅ No duplicate or incorrectly typed notifications

## Notification Types Summary
- `SOIL_ANALYSIS_SAVED` - For soil analysis operations
- `PLANT_SCAN_COMPLETED` - For plant scan operations (NEW)
- `SYSTEM_ALERT` - For errors and warnings
- `NFT_MINTED` - For NFT creation
- `FARM_UPDATE` - For farm-related updates
- `RECOMMENDATION` - For general recommendations

The notification system is now properly organized with single responsibility!
