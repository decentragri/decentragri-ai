/**
 * Cypher query string to save sensor data and its interpretation in a Neo4j database.
 *
 * This query performs the following operations:
 * - Merges (creates if not exists) a User node with the given username.
 * - Merges a Farm node with the given farm name and associates it with the user via an OWNS relationship.
 * - Merges a Sensor node with the given sensorId and associates it with the farm via a HAS_SENSOR relationship.
 * - Creates a Reading node with various sensor data properties (fertility, moisture, ph, temperature, sunlight, humidity, cropType, username, createdAt).
 * - Creates an Interpretation node with the provided interpretation value.
 * - Links the Sensor node to the Reading node via a HAS_READING relationship.
 * - Links the Reading node to the Interpretation node via an INTERPRETED_AS relationship.
 *
 * @constant
 * @type {string}
 * @see {@link https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/} for Cypher query language reference.
 * @param {string} $username - The username of the user.
 * @param {string} $farmName - The name of the farm.
 * @param {string} $sensorId - The unique identifier for the sensor.
 * @param {number} $fertility - The fertility value from the sensor.
 * @param {number} $moisture - The moisture value from the sensor.
 * @param {number} $ph - The pH value from the sensor.
 * @param {number} $temperature - The temperature value from the sensor.
 * @param {number} $sunlight - The sunlight value from the sensor.
 * @param {number} $humidity - The humidity value from the sensor.
 * @param {string} $cropType - The type of crop associated with the reading.
 * @param {string} $createdAt - The timestamp when the reading was created.
 * @param {string} $interpretation - The interpretation of the reading.

/**
 * Cypher query to retrieve sensor data and their interpretations for a specific farm owned by a user.
 *
 * @remarks
 * - Matches a user by username and finds the farm they own by farm name.
 * - Retrieves all sensors associated with the farm and their readings.
 * - Optionally matches any interpretations for each reading.
 * - Returns the farm name, sensor ID, reading details, and interpretation value (if available).
 * - Results are ordered by the reading's creation date in descending order.
 *
 * @param {string} $username - The username of the user who owns the farm.
 * @param {string} $farmName - The name of the farm to retrieve sensor data for.
 *
 * @returns {Object[]} An array of objects containing:
 *   - farmName: The name of the farm.
 *   - sensorId: The unique identifier of the sensor.
 *   - reading: The reading node with all its properties.
 *   - interpretation: The interpreted value of the reading, if available.
